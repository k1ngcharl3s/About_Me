    <string name="bio">Hello, my name is Charles.
\n\nI love technology and writing.
\n\nWriting was one of my very first loves of life. I also, became enamored with technology as a teen.
\n\nFun fact is that I have wrote thousands of songs and poems.
\n\nAs a teen, I used to write multiple songs a day.
\n\nI have a Bachelors Degree in App Development.
\n\nCurrently, I am taking the Android Kotlin Developer at Udacity.
\n\nIn my spare time, I practice learning how to develop various apps to hone my skills.\n\n </string>
